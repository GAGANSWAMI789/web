		HTML- structure or layout of webpage
CSS-  Look & Feel ...to beautify the web page elements
JS-  Dynamic Website means it can handle Events and can do form validation
<!-- JS- JavaScript----dynamic website
1)Static website
2)Dynamic website-event handling, form validation etc.
Events done by user-
1)Keyboard----oninput,onchange,onkeypress,onkeyup,onkeydown etc.
2)Mouse---onclick,onmouseover,onmouseout,ondblclick etc.
3)window---onload,onunload,onscroll,onresize
4)Form---onchange,onfocus,onblur,oninput
-------------------------------------------

JS-Script language
Script language
1)client-side -----don't need any server. eg. Javascript,VBscript
2)server-side ----it needs any web server with web browser to work. eg. PHP,Python,JAVA etc.
JS is a mother language ,and developed many frameworks and library files eg. React JS, Angular, Node JS, Jquery etc.
---------------------
Rules-
1)case sensitive language.   almost in small-case, but methods in camelcase.
2)end each statement with ;
3)JS is object based language. Every object has some properties and methods. eg.
car-object
color,price,model---property
start,stop----methods(functions)
------------------------------------
There are two types of comments in JavaScript.

Single-line Comment-      //
Multi-line Comment-      /*             */

Three Places to put JavaScript code
1.Between the body tag of html
2.Between the head tag of html
3.In .js file (external javaScript)
------------------------------

<!-- External file of JS -->
Advantages of External JavaScript
There will be following benefits if a user creates an external javascript:

It helps in the reusability of code in more than one HTML file.
It allows easy code readability.
It is time-efficient as web browsers cache the external js files, which further reduces the page loading time.
It enables both web designers and coders to work with html and js files parallelly and separately, i.e., without facing any code conflictions.
The length of the code reduces as only we need to specify the location of the js file.

Disadvantages of External JavaScript
There are the following disadvantages of external files:

The stealer may download the coder's code using the url of the js file.
If two js files are dependent on one another, then a failure in one file may affect the execution of the other dependent file.
The web browser needs to make an additional http request to get the js code.
A tiny to a large change in the js code may cause unexpected results in all its dependent files.
We need to check each file that depends on the commonly created external javascript file.
If it is a few lines of code, then better to implement the internal javascript code.

Output methods
1)document.write
2)console.log
3)window.alert
4)innerHTML -->






</pre>
<h1 id=ddd >First Class of Js....</h1>
<button onclick="document.getElementById('ddd').innerHTML='Wow..I am now changed...h1'"> Click Me</button>
<br>
<!-- External JS file
 --><script type="text/javascript" src="hello.js"></script>
<!-- Internal JS  -->
<script type="text/javascript">
// Methods of output	
// 1. document.write()-display in body
document.write("welcome class of JS<br>enjoy it");
// 2. alert()-display in seperate popup or window.alert() bcoz alert is method of window object
alert("Wow!...");
//3. console.log()-press f12 to see the info in console,use for debugging by programmer
console.log("i am here in console");
//4. innerHTML- to change the contents or to display content of any element

// document.getElementById("ddd").innerHTML="Wow...changed";

JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to
JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java.
JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the
name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been
embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.
The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript
language.
 JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript Translator (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser.


 Designed for creating network-centric applications.
 Complementary to and integrated with Java.
 Complementary to and integrated with HTML.
 Open and cross-platform.


Javascript is the language to add the dynamic behavior to the static website pages. Whenever you see the pop-ups on click of button, sliding animations, or form validations, all this special effect and logic is by JavaScript only.

JavaScript is a scripting language which is used to add the dynamic nature and user interaction to the static html web pages. When we make a web page with basic languages (HTML & CSS), then we see a basic skeleton which is beautified with CSS Properties. But, what of events like to show a pop-up on clicking a button or to show error text in red to user on entering an invalid name (like putting numbers with text). Tasks like these cannot be only handled by HTML & CSS. They are used to provide basic skeleton to the web page and preparing a basic dom (document object model) by HTML and beautifying the web page or already created dom elements by the help of CSS. Providing user interaction, complex animations, validation, detecting HTML5 support (as done by Modernizr JS Library) is currently out of scope of these basic languages. We need JavaScript basically for these tasks.

JavaScript is mother of most of libraries or Frameworks that you would have herd -- "jQuery, Dojo, YUI Framework, Angular, React, Ember JS, Vue JS, Aurelia, Mustache, Handlebars, and on and on ....". Master JavaScript, that must be your goal. If you hold the spirit, to control the body is not a big task.
JavaScript basically is used to bring user interaction and enhance user experience. Also, most of the logical work can be shifted from backend to front end thereby releasing the valuable resource usage from backend server to client computer, ie, on the browser.<br>
JavaScript can "display" output in different ways:
// JavaScript output can be-
// 1.Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
// 2.Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
// 3.Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
// 4.Writing into the browser console, using console.log().(press F12 to see result in console) -->

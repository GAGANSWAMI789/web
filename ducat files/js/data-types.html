// Data types are the main building blocks of any computer language. These are basically the formats 
//to store data in the form of variables.JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need 
//to specify type of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine. You need to use
//var here to specify the data type. It can hold any type of values such as numbers, strings etc. For
//example:
var a=40;//holding number  
var b="Rahul";//holding string  
//You can declare many variables in one statement.
var a=40, b="Ram",c=70;
//If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, it will not lose its value.

//The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements

var carName = "Volvo";
var carName;		//carname will have volvo
//JavaScript identifiers (names) must begin with:A letter (A-Z or a-z),A dollar sign ($),Or an
//underscore (_)

// There are 7 data types in JavaScript which can be broadly classified into 2 groups:

// Primitive: A primitive data value is a single simple data value with no additional properties and 
//methods.JavaScript has dynamic types.This includes 6 of the data-types:

// 1.Boolean
// 2.Null
// 3.Undefined
// 4.Number
// 5.String
// 6.Symbol (ECMAScript 6)-This data-type is new to JavaScript. Symbol is unique and immutable pritive
// value which might be used as key of an Object Property.

// Non-Primitive: 
// 1.Object	represents instance through which we can access members
// 2.Array	represents group of similar values
// 3.RegExp	represents regular expression
// Object-Objects are data types representing the real world entities. They have data in the form of 
//key-value pair.Objects are at the very core of JavaScript. An object is an entity in JavaScript which
// often resembles real-world things or objects. For example, an object named myCar can have properties
//representing inherent characteristics such as -- color, weight, height and also other real-world 
//characteristics such as -- Brand, Model, etc.Every object has a collection of properties and property-values.
// if use strict then it will not allow any variable directly without declaration
"use strict";        

	var x,y,z;			// declaration of all
	x=80;			// Defining x is number
	y="ducat";     //Defining y is string    but z is undefined
	c="hello"; //can use any variable without declaration but if not using strict mode
	document.write("<br>data type of x:",typeof(x));
document.write("<br> data type of y:",typeof(y));
x=null;      // x is null type
document.write("<br>data type of x:",typeof(x));
document.write("<br>data type of z:",typeof(z));
z=["ram",23,"clerk"];   //array
// Array is a collection of more than one type of information stored in a single variable,
// but position number starts from 0.  array is also an object type

document.write("<br>Name of Employee:",z[0]);
document.write("<br>Age of Employee:",z[1]);
